# Changing header of ambient noise data in marine exploration
Moving the ocean bottom seismometers on the sea floor
demands the necessity of the relocation corrections on the recorded data. We have written a python code to make this step easier.
Before executing, the Sac software must be installed.
Other parts of the header can be corrected accordingly.
The Python script should be executed in the terminal.

We would be happy if you could cite our paper for acknowledgement.
